                    If you’re a blonde you are probably used to having a toner to maximise your blonde potential. Toners are colours that change the tone of the hair. I.E a toner can cancel out warm, yellow tones or change your blonde to a beautiful rose gold. 
                    Please note - It will take about an extra 15 minutes.
